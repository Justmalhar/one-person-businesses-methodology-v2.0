# "Solo Entrepreneur Methodology" Second Edition

## Improvements from the First Edition

1. From a long article to a small book of nearly 60,000 words, evolving from spontaneous sharing to a **complete methodology** developed over two years.
2. Expanding beyond solo development to become a **more universal methodology**, allowing non-technical readers to create digital products or build online services with the aid of NoCode/open source projects + AI.
